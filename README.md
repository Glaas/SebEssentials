# Toolbelt

*note; some of the tools here have have now their own repo for easier maintaining and flexibility. For example, the curves library has been moved to [Easings](https://github.com/Glaas/Easings)*

**Toolbelt** is a collection of tools for [Unity](https://unity.com), created to avoid the hassle to re-create the same scripts over and over again. New features and tools will be added as I create more things that I want to re-use in the future.

TODO; List of features goes here
